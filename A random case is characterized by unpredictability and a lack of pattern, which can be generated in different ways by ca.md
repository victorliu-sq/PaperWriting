A random case is characterized by unpredictability and a lack of pattern, which can be generated in different ways by casually changing the preference lists. 

In real-world matching scenarios, preferences are seldom entirely random; they generally follow certain major and minor categories.

For instance, in a college admission process where students rank their preferred colleges, the primary factor might be the overall reputation of the institution, forming clusters that follow a fixed order. Within each cluster, the specific rankings of colleges are randomized to reflect individual preferences, such as campus environment, specific programs, or financial aid options.

In this paper, our case is generated by grouping preferences into clusters without a specific purpose, maintaining a fixed order for each group to simulate agents being ordered by one main factor, while the ranks within each group are randomized to reflect additional influencing factors.

For example, consider a college admission process where students rank colleges. The primary factor could be the overall reputation of the college, forming clusters that follow a fixed order. Within each cluster, the specific rankings of colleges are randomized to reflect personal preferences such as campus environment, specific programs, or financial aid packages.



In this paper, we simulate a random case by grouping preferences into different clusters with a fixed order  without a specific purpose,.

Within each group, the order is randomized to simulate minor influcences





 while maintaining the same order of preferences within each group



This approach mimics real-life scenarios where agentsâ€™ preferences are influenced by primary factors but within those primary categories, the exact ranking can vary due to secondary factors.
